<h3>#45DaysOfCode: JavaScript Learning Journey</h3>
<p>
  Welcome to my 45-day challenge where I dive deep into JavaScript!<br>
  This space serves as a personal log and showcase of everything I've built, broken, and learned along the way.<br>
  It's a dumpyard of experiments and a track record of growth  from basics to building cool projects.
